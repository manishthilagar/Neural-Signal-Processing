## Neural Signal Processing

This repository, "Neural Signal Processing", is dedicated to signal processing techniques applied to neural data. The primary focus will be on analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) and other bio-signals. The repository will leverage various Python packages specialized in different aspects of signal processing.

### Packages Used

The following Python packages will be predominantly utilized for signal processing tasks:

1. **MNE-Python**: A comprehensive library for EEG data processing, including reading, preprocessing, visualization, and analysis.
   
2. **NeuroKit2**: This library provides tools for EEG and bio-signal analysis, offering features for preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
   
3. **YASA**: YASA is used for spectral analysis and sleep staging of EEG data. It provides functions for time-frequency analysis and sleep stage classification.
   
4. **Frites**: Frites is a tool for connectivity analysis and statistical testing, particularly useful for investigating functional brain networks.
   
5. **Entropy**: A library for entropy-based time series analysis, offering functions for computing various entropy measures.
   
6. **Tensorpac**: Tensorpac is employed for phase-amplitude coupling analysis, a technique used to study the relationship between different frequency components of neural oscillations.
   
7. **Visbrain**: Visbrain provides tools for 3D visualization of neural data and brain connectivity, enabling interactive exploration of brain activity patterns.
   
8. **Neurodsp**: Neurodsp is used for digital time series data analysis, with a focus on oscillatory signals. It offers functions for filtering, oscillatory component detection, and parameter estimation.

These packages collectively offer a comprehensive suite of tools for analyzing neural signals, covering a wide range of preprocessing, analysis, and visualization tasks.
